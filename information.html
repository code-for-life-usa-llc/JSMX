            <h2>How did AI started</h2>
            <p>Research began in 1956 with the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, organized
                by Dartmouth College professor John McCarthy. <br> The conference's goals were to develop ideas about
                thinking machines,  such as how to help machines use <br> language, form concepts, solve problems, and
                improve themselves. It was a theoretical way to differentiate between humans and AI.</p>

            <h2>Who invented AI?</h2>
            <p>In 1955,<br> McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" and organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth
                College in 1956 to explore the idea of thinking machines. The workshop, which is widely considered the
                founding moment of AI research, aimed to develop ways for machines to <br> use language, solve problems,
                and improve themselves.McCarthy is also credited with developing Lisp, a popular programming language used
                in AI research. McCarthy is often called the "father of AI"</p>
             
            <h2>How is AI going to help us in the future</h2> 
            <p>What does the future of AI look like? AI is expected to improve industries like healthcare, manufacturing and customer service, leading to higher-quality experiences for both workers and customers.</h2>
