            <h2>How did AI started</h2>
            <p>Research began in 1956 with the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, organized
                by Dartmouth College professor John McCarthy. <br> The conference's goals were to develop ideas about
                thinking machines, <br> such as how to help machines use language, form concepts, solve problems, and
                improve themselves. It was a theoretical way to differentiate between humans and AI.</p>

            <h2>Who invented AI?</h2>
            <p>In 1955,<br> McCarthy coined the term "artificial intelligence" and organized a summer workshop at Dartmouth
                College in 1956 to explore the idea of thinking machines. The workshop, which is widely considered the
                founding moment of AI research, <br> aimed to develop ways for machines to use language, solve problems,
                and
                improve themselves.McCarthy is also credited with developing Lisp, a popular programming language used
                in
                AI research. McCarthy is often called the "father of AI"</p>
